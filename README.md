### Welcome to my Github profile! ###



My neuefische Data Analtics bootcamp capstone project is :gb: POInterest - London Airbnb Explorer :gb:
POInterest is a dashboard tool that uses data combined from Airbnb, the Overpass API & Google Maps (via Selenium and Beautiful Soup) to filter for and find the optimal environment of Airbnbs for travelers.

The Tableau Dashboard:
<p>(1) filters by both Airbnb and POI filters</p>
<p>(2) checks for fair prices via linear regression</p>
<p>(3) helps you understanding your neighbourhood better</p>
<p>(4) allows you to book an Airbnb directly in the interface</p>
<p> </p>
