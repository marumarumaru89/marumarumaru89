### Welcome to my Github profile! ###
I am a graduate of the University of Hamburg with a degree in economics.


Having rediscovered my love for numbers and data, I recently completed a full-time three month Data Analytics bootcamp at neuefische in Hamburg. In March 2022, I completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.


Until 12/2022, I did mainly qualitative analytical work at Nippon Life Insurance, Japan's largest life insurer.
My strengths are in analytical problem solving and Python/SQL and I have a keen interest in data engineering.


My bootcamp capstone project was :gb: POInterest - London Airbnb Explorer :gb:


POInterest is a dashboard tool that uses data combined from Airbnb, the Overpass API & Google Maps (via Selenium and Beautiful Soup) to filter for and find the optimal environment of Airbnbs for travelers.

The Tableau Dashboard:
* filters by both Airbnb and POI filters</p>
* checks for fair prices via linear regression</p>
* helps you understanding your neighbourhood better</p>
* allows you to book an Airbnb directly in the interface</p>
<p> </p>
